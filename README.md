# Major Cyber Security Project

## Project Title
Attack, Detect and Secure a Cloud-Based Linux Infrastructure using SIEM

## Description
This project demonstrates a real-world cybersecurity workflow where a cloud-based Linux server was attacked, monitored, and hardened.

Red Team activities included:
- Port scanning using Nmap
- Web enumeration using Nikto
- SSH attack simulation

Blue Team activities included:
- Log analysis (auth.log, Apache access logs)
- Identification of misconfigurations
- SSH hardening (key-based authentication)
- Firewall hardening using UFW
- Re-attack validation after hardening

## Tools Used
- AWS EC2
- Ubuntu Server 24.04
- Nmap
- Nikto
- SSH
- UFW Firewall
- Wazuh SIEM (conceptual due to resource limits)

## Outcome
The project successfully demonstrated before-and-after security posture comparison and reflects real-world SOC operations.
